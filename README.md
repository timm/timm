### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a IEEE Fellow prof (full), CS, NCstate, USA.   
You can reach me at timm@ieee.org

I do SE, AI, data mining, optimization, explanation, privacy, fairness and prog languages.
In my job, I do lottsa science (see [my papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7htTUTgmLtUC&hl=en)) and help lottsa of people supercharge their careers (supervised 18 completed Ph.D.s and 6 in progress). 

As to what I research, I'm trying to change that.  I'm alarmed , to say the least,   current      SE for AI practicess--  so much rush to "ship it" without thinking about what "it" is. So I've been working on  issues of fairness and ethics.  To date, me and my graduate students have found general principles for automatically adjusting the fairness inside models learned by AI. Those results have lead to successful publications and successfully completed phds 

- https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.20/39557
- https://2021.esec-fse.org/details/fse-2021-papers/7/Bias-in-Machine-Learning-Software-Why-How-What-to-Do-
-  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9951398

But they have also  highlighted just how much more work is needed to  make "fairness" scalable and practical.

So now i seek a new kind of phd student. Not one just steeped in AI (and whose career goal is to rush out to a standard industry job),  but someone who wants to be more reflective, more radical, and wants to use their phd to explore issues related to trusted communication   and more respect to the people using our tools . 

Is that you? If yes, then  perhaps i can help you towards a  very different kind of career path,  way ahead of the curve, which would position you to become leaders in the ethical future of software
